I am a Technical Expert in [Server Log Service (SLS)](https://www.aliyun.com/product/sls/) at [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/) working on cloud telemetry and AIOps. Before joining in Alibaba, I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL)](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/), [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), advised by Professor [Christina Delimitrou](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~delimitrou/). I am interested in cloud computing, microservices, ML for systems and computer architecture. My research focuses on building and managing large-scale microservices in datacenters, improving their performance and resource efficiency. Before studying at Cornell, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in 2016.

I was a Ph.D. software engineering intern and student researcher at [Google](https://ai.google/) in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, hosted by [David Lo](https://ai.google/research/people/DavidLo), [Sundar Dev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sundardev/) and Qian Xi. During my internship, I did research on using machine learning to improve resource efficiency and detect performance issues of large scale distributed services in Google Cloud.

I have been fortunate to receive Jacobs Fellowship in 2016 and two IEEE Micro TopPicks Awards in 2020 and 2022.
